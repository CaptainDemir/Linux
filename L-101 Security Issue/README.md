# Project-101 : Security Issue

## Problem Statement
Companies have problems based on their infrastructures and needs. In this project, you will be working in different roles and you will be assigned some tasks which have backing up, security issues, user and password management, and some string manipulation duties. Sometimes, you need to prepair some bash script files or execute some commands, to be able to accomplish them. There are four tasks. Manager's instructions belonging them can be found below. Please read them carefully and fulfill requirements. Good Luck!

## L-101: 
You are working in a Financial Company as DevSecOps. Recently, one of your instances has been terminated by someone within the firm. That instance was very important for firm's web-app and also your infrastructure has been affected by this termination. Your team lead is suspecting `Serdar` user. You have assigned to find instances' ids terminated by `Serdar` user. You have Cloudtrail event history file named `event_history.csv`. Instance ids within this event history look like `i-0c127ab5cdf997cf4`. You have to apply some filtering and string manipulation commands to find ids. To be able to handle this tasks, you decided to create a bash script, then, save instances' ids terminated by `Serdar` user in `result.txt` file.
