# Linux-102 : 

## Description

You will be working in different roles during this project and assigned to various tasks. These tasks will be based on the problems faced by a DevOps in his/her daily life.

## Problem Statement
Companies have problems based on their infrastructures and needs. In this project, you will be working in different roles and you will be assigned some tasks which have backing up, security issues, user and password management, and some string manipulation duties. Sometimes, you need to prepair some bash script files or execute some commands, to be able to accomplish them. There are four tasks. Manager's instructions belonging them can be found below. Please read them carefully and fulfill requirements. Good Luck!


## L-102: User and Password Script
You're working as a System Administrator for a e-commerce company. The latest company initiative requires you to write an ansible file for dozens of servers. You're falling behind schedule and are going to miss your deadline for these ansible files because you are constantly being interrupted by the HR calling you to create new Linux accounts for all the people in the company who have been recruited to test out the company's newest Linux-based application.

In order to meet your deadline and keep your sanity, you decide to write a shell script that will create new user account and automatically generate a password for each of new account. Once you're done with the shell script you can put the HR in charge of creating new accounts which will finally allow you to work uninterrupted and complete your server deployments on time. 

Your script accepts user account name and comments as parameter. Then create a new user and a password for them. At the same time, you want users to change their password, when they login the system at the first time. Please create this bash scripting file named `user_password.sh`.
